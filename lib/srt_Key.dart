     learned use of 
       - scroll view
       - navigator in button
       - routing and static 
     always using static is not a good practice.
     make the value of the debugShowCheckedModeBanner as false in main.dart -> to remove debug banner while running

     Drawback of last day button : Once it is clicked it didn't come back to it's original state
     Solution : 1. make animatedContainer -> ink (similar to container -> adv = it can give better effects and 
                   decoration as well as it will go with inkWell too) -------- not optimal becoz we want to use animatedContainer
                2. wrap inkWell with another widget becoz it need material as ancestor
                   (Note: whenever we are giving ancestor as material then it's child must not contain decoration)

    ** If we want appbar then we can replace the material widget(root) to scaffold and then place appbar 
    Learned : how to put repeal effect comes in container, use of form, how to validate on textFields.
